## Architecture

Each business domain operates as a completely independent application with its own repository, tech stack, and infrastructure. This approach provides:

1. **Maximum Flexibility** - Each domain can choose its own technology
2. **Independent Scaling** - Domains scale based on their usage
3. **Team Separation** - Different teams can own different domains  
4. **Business Model Flexibility** - Each domain can have its own pricing
5. **Future Exit Strategy** - Domains can be sold or spun off independently
